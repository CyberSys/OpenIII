# OpenIII
This project is codenamed as OpenIII. Despite the fact that this tool is also related to the Grand Theft Auto modding like it's similar-named project OpenIV there is no relation to OpenIV, .black - the RAGE research project or any OpenIV developer. The real project name is still not yet selected and OpenIII is used more like "working codename" for a tool that is aiming to do similar things like OpenIV but for the 3D era of GTA.

## Build requirements

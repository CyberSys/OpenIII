## Project name notice

This project is codenamed as **OpenIII**. Despite the fact that this tool is also related to the Grand Theft Auto modding like it's similar-named project **OpenIV** there is no relation to **OpenIV**, **.black** - the RAGE research project or any **OpenIV** developer. The real project name is still not yet selected and **OpenIII** is used more like "working codename" for a tool that is aiming to do similar things like **OpenIV** but for the 3D era of GTA.
